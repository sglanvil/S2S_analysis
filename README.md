## Notes
We had issues with runs, and had to rename three cases. The netcdf attributes in the ../archive/.. hist-files may have incorrect names, but the subdirectories and files will have the correct names. The postprocessed data (eg, priority 1,2,3) doesn't have attributes with case name info (so it's nothing to worry about).

S2SHINDCASTSclimoALL --> S2SHINDCASTSclimoATMclimoLND

S2SHINDCASTSclimoALLFIX --> S2SHINDCASTSclimoALL

S2SHINDCASTSclimoOCNFIXclimoLND --> S2SHINDCASTSclimoOCNclimoLND

S2SHINDCASTSclimoOCNclimoLND --> REMOVED (because it was the same as climoLND)
